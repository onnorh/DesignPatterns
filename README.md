# Design Patterns
Python and Javascript Implementation to the design patterns, using social network as the subject

Currently learning software design patterns through reading books and online resources, I would be writing codes that implements these design patterns using my own interpretation.

Although this may serve as a reference for other developers out there, I cannot guarantee that my interpretation is 100% correct. So, please feel free to correct my definition or my code even.

Thanks for taking the time to review this repository!
