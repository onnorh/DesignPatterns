# Design Patterns
Python and Javascript Implementation to the design patterns

Currently learning software design patterns through reading books and online resources, I will be writing codes that implements these design patterns using my own interpretation.

This is for my own development but I hope this can be useful to other developers as well. Although this may serve as a reference for other developers out there, I cannot guarantee that my interpretation is 100% correct. So, please feel free to correct my definition or my code even.

I will try to make the definition as simple as possible. The examples will fall under the social media category where more people can relate easily.

Thanks for taking the time to review this repository!
