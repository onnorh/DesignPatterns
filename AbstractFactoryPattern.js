/**
  * Abstract Factory Pattern - provides an interface for creating families of
  * related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It
  * acts like a salesman who creates a generic order form, find clients, take
  * orders and send the orders to a group of factories to make the products.
  *
  * Example - Different types of user may opt for a set of properties in their
  * account, these set of properties are also differentiated by the type of the user.
  * Say, an American User uses a different type of profile layout and payment
  * service as compared to a British User, this difference can be due to culture
  * or environment
